# Linux Shell
Basic Linux shell developed using C

The shell is an interactive interface that allows users to execute other commands and utilities in Linux and other UNIX-based operating systems.<br/><br/>
Linux shells are a lot more powerful than the Windows command line, because they function as a scripting language as well, with a complete set of tools. Multiple shells can be installed on a system and it is possible to quickly switch between them. <br/>
